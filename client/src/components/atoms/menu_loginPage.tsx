// READ THIS:
// Remember that is a stardard in React to name the components files capitalized, meaning
// if your component is something related to the manu, the right name is: MenuLoginPage.tsx. On the other hand,
// also remember that we do not use underscore in naming components, it is not part of the standard.

export default function MenuloginPage() {
  return (
    <div>
        


    </div>
  )
